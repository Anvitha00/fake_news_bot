# 📰 Fake News Bot 🤖

This project is an **end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline** that classifies news as **fake** or **real** using Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
It was developed as part of my **MLOps learning journey**, focusing on best practices for building, tracking, and deploying ML models.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📥 **Data Ingestion** from Kaggle
- 🧹 **Text Preprocessing** using:
  - TF-IDF
  - CountVectorizer
- 🧠 **Model Training** with:
  - Logistic Regression (as the finalized model)
  - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- 📊 **Experiment Tracking** with MLflow
- 📦 **Model Versioning** using MLflow Model Registry
- 📁 **Data & Pipeline Versioning** with DVC
- 🖼️ **Streamlit UI** (Work In Progress)

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, MLflow, DVC  
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, VS Code, Streamlit  
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow  
- **Pipeline & Data Versioning**: DVC

---

## 🔮 Upcoming Integrations

These tools will be added as part of the next phase of MLOps learning and deployment:

- 🐳 **Docker** – Containerization of the ML model and app
- ☸️ **Kubernetes** – Orchestration and scaling of Docker containers
- 📈 **Grafana + Prometheus** – Real-time monitoring of model performance and system metrics
- 🔁 **CI/CD** – Automating the testing and deployment pipeline

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Develop a robust ML pipeline from data to deployment
- Understand and apply MLOps tools in real-world workflows
- Improve reproducibility, scalability, and model governance
